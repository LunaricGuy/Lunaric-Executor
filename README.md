Open/Run " executor_Lunar1.2 " or " executor_Lunar1.2.py " It's one of those 2 I guess If it does not work you might need Python 3.1.1 or +  AND IF IT STILL DOES NOT WORK, Open Command Prompt then write  cd Desktop enter cd Lunar Executor enter (Name of the executor's File) python executor_Lunar1.2.py enter (name of the executor) if you rename the executor you should still type ".py" at the end  You may encounter some bugs.
