Updated again lol this is the latest working Roblox executor called " Lunar " which supports every script for FREE! Open/Run " executor_Lunar1.2 " or " executor_Lunar1.2.py " It's one of those 2 I guess

If it does not work you might need Python 3.1.1 or + AND IF IT STILL DOES NOT WORK,

Open Command Prompt then write: cd Desktop enter write: cd Lunar Executor enter (Name of the executor's File) (last) write: python executor_Lunar1.2.py enter (name of the executor)

if you rename the executor you should still type ".py" at the end You may encounter some bugs.

ALSO TRIED FIXING LUNAR 1.1 IF 1.2 DOES NOT WORK
